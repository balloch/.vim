# Personal .vim preferences

## vim_plugins
a bunch of submodules that are my default plugins for vim
```
~/.vim/pack/uiux
```
For color schemes, highlighting, etc.
```
~/.vim/pack/syntax
```
For compilers, linters, autocomplete, etc.
```
~/.vim/pack/other 
```
Things that don't fit in the other two bins (e.g. operational stuff like git and docker plugins)
